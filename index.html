									<h3>The Forgotten Story</h3>
									<p>It’s been two whole years. And I might have forgotten. I might not remember it all correctly. But from what I was told she waited all day. All through that day she waited and hoped that at least one of them would remember – remember that it was her birthday. But none of them did.</p>
									<p>And at the end of the day, she sat at one corner of her room and began to weep. She hated her life as it was, her family and the family conditions she was forced to live in. She was beginning to think that her life was not worth living anymore. And that’s when he came in, so silently that she couldn’t even hear him through the door. He sat down right beside her, raised her head up by the chin, looked into her tear filled eyes for a moment, smiled briefly and said at last with a voice so soft, it could be only be heard by her, “Happy Birthday, my little sister!”</p>
									<p>
									With that she burst into tears. All her life her brother had been the only one who had really been there for her. All others were there as a mere decoration. She hugged hum tightly and didn’t’ let go until her eyes had run out of tears to shed. That whole moment froze and when it had passed her brother took her by the hand and took her for a walk outside.</p>
									<p>
										He wrapped his arms around her, for the night wind was cold and he didn’t want her to feel the freezing weather. Not one word was uttered as they walked the path that led towards the river. A tree stood a few feet from the river under which the two sat.
										“Look at the clear blue sky. Aren’t the stars just beautiful?” said her brother.
									“Yes, they are.”</p>
									<p>
										“I know the times are hard for you right now but remember, Rose, all life is a game. Things will be difficult at times but giving up is never an option. Facing them head to head and overcoming them is what will make you grow, make you stronger… little by little. Don’t let the world get you down, Rose. When the world gives you a hundred reasons to cry, give life one reason to smile. Because even one small reason is enough to make you smile and bring happiness in times of grief. Everything thereafter will be alright.”
									“What if there comes a time when I have no reason to smile?”</p>
									<p>
									“That is not possible, Rose. If ever such a time should come, close your eyes and look deep into your heart. And trust me when I say this, you’ll find your reason and that’ll make you smile.”</p>
									<p>
									“I trust you…” she said finally, letting out a smile.</p>
									<p>
									The only sound they could hear then was the cold wind blowing softly to their ears and the sound of the river flowing. Rose walked up to the river and watched her reflection. There she could see a version of herself that was all drowned in sadness. She dipped her hand in the water and that version was now gone. All that remained was a blurry picture. And then she noticed the water flowing – not stopping for even a moment and making its way past any obstacle that stood in its way. She realized what she had to do then. “Let us go brother. It’s time for me to move on now.”</p>
									<p>
									I would be lying if I said she didn’t catch me by surprise when I saw her for the first time during our bridge course classes. Indeed her innocent beauty and character were what had me falling for her in the first place. But little did I know that beneath that innocent smile, was a person bearing such pain as cannot be described in words alone. In a world where I had barely any friends, she was one of the few ones I made during that period. Rose and her friends, we sat together in class. I remember those days when we would sit six in a bench of three. Uncomfortable? Oh, hell yes! But the interesting talks and jokes made the air worth the while.</p>
									<p>
									Two whole years! That’s exactly how long it has been. And yet after all this time I can remember every moment she and I spent along with our gang. Those were indeed the golden periods of my life. I can remember laughing – all of us. And that time when Rose would copy the answers from me during the weekly exams. And of course, the time when I answered every single question the teacher asked during the English class one time. No doubt there – it was fun.</p>
									<p>
									We became close friends – all of us. But Rose meant somewhat more to me. She and I shared every little detail of our pasts. I told her about my mid-school crush for whom I had gone head over heels and she told me one day that she was already spoken for. Was I sad to hear that? Did my heart skip a beat? Well, to tell the truth, I really don’t know. But what I had felt didn’t go away with her being in a relationship. It stayed and grew stronger with time. It grew into what would be an everlasting bond – an evergreen friendship and that includes the whole group.</p>
									<p>
									After three months of being together, our gang had to part. Each of us had to go our separate ways. Five friends, five different destinations. Would their paths cross again? Who knew then? All of us got into different colleges and Rose was the only one I managed to stay in touch properly. There was a time when I went to stay with my grandparents during college. And during those days I would meet her after her college got over and we would walk together to my stop. And though it was only a few minutes to my stop, it sure was sweet talk. And I guess that explains our bond getting closer.</p>
									<p>
										Oh, how wonderful were those times, now that I recall. She was happy, from the outside – yes, but from the inside she was drowning.
									Her smile was always something special, not that it was rare but somehow it was mysterious and only now do I understand why. There was one day when she was dressed in a black kurta and my! Did she look beautiful! It seemed as if the sorrows that had been buried deep within her had somehow surfaced to match the color of her dress. And yet she was smiling. I say, you can’t get stronger than that.</p>
									<p>
									Her problem? Her problem was freedom. She never had any freedom. She was literally trapped in her home except for college. She was a caged squirrel and no matter what she couldn’t break out of the steel bars. I look back now at the conversations that we exchanged and notice that every single time that I and my gang asked her to go out somewhere, she would have the same reason, “I can’t.” And as time passed by we wouldn’t even need to ask because we already knew her answer. I however, asked every time, hoping that she would be allowed. And poor Rose never had the courage to ask her parents; she was too afraid and with the pass of time had killed her hope of ever being free to do anything she wanted as long as she remained in that house. But things had yet to get worse two years ago. </p>
									<p>
									Two years later things are different and yet all the more same. She is where she was – inside the steel cage. She’s graduated from high school – well she’s appeared for the final exams to be more precise. But I believe even that was a long and difficult road for her. Just about a month before the final exams, the family problem reached its climax. She told me that it was because of her that her father and grandpa got into a fight and when her brother got there to pacify the situation, her grandpa accidentally broke his back. Her father and mother are both ill. Her brother left the house along with his wife. Part by part, the family was falling apart. And now little Rose had to take responsibility of the whole house as her two elder sisters were already married leaving only her who could take care of it. That burden…if only I could relieve her of it.</p>
									<p>
									Two years later she comes to me no more saying she’s unable to sleep because of the loud music system in a neighbor’s party. She no longer asks me to be her tutor anymore. And she doesn’t text me saying she went to a party and instead of getting her mooed switched on, she was feeling even more depressed. Two years later she doesn’t ask me to cheer her up and inspire her to study. Two years later she comes to me saying that she doesn’t want to live anymore. She’s frustrated with her life. She wants to suicide but doesn’t have the courage. She’s burning from the inside. She doesn’t know what to do; she too has dreams but can’t fulfill them because of her family. And what do I say? I say, “Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be just fine.”</p>
									<p>
									I finally met Rose a few weeks ago and it’s been a long time coming. No, she hadn’t changed one bit on the outside – she was still as beautiful as ever. She’s been getting out of it slowly. She’s now broken up with her boyfriend. And I couldn’t fail to notice that she was coming back to her old cheerful self now. I can still remember the times when she was depressed and our conversation on the phone turned totally one sided. Now, at least that has changed. But there’s one slight problem now, I’ve fallen for her again. And I have the text just ready on my hands and it says “There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you Rose, I’m thinking I’m in love with you.” It’s just a click away from being sent. But I’m having second thoughts about this. Should I or should I not tell her how I feel?</p>
									<p>
									Again, I know not how she feels. Deep inside I’m not sure I feel the same myself. But I don’t think I can contain it anymore. Two years. For two whole years I’ve been keeping it down and now it has pushed its way back into my heart. What do I do now? Probably the answer to my question is going to be a no. Because she’s scared of a commitment; she knows I like her but because she’s afraid she will not accept it. But it matters not what the answer is. I only want her to know how I really feel about her. That I care for her as more than just a friend; I want her to know that I’ll be there for her no matter what. And I will still be her friend after all of this mess I’m going to create; nothing will have changed between us.</p>
									<p>
									If this story should ever reach her hands, she’ll realize right away that it’s written for her. And perhaps she’ll get angry. But it will not matter by that time. Because all I want her to know that if I could give her one gift in this world, it would be freedom. My only wish would be to set her free, even if that meant I had to give up everything myself. I want to give her wings so that she can break free of the cages and soar high above the skies. She’s always been an angel, helping me through my difficult times and now I want to do her this favor – make her realize that there is always a reason to make the heart smile. I want to make her a true angel.</p>
